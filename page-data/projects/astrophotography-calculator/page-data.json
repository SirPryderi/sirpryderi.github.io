Calculating the correct exposure time on the field can be tricky, and many approximation rules (e.g.: 400 rule) are often way off from the actual value. This app just solves all of that!\n\nBecome an early access tester by clicking <ExternalLink text=\"here\" href=\"https://play.google.com/apps/testing/io.github.sirpryderi.astrophotographycalculator\" /> to receive the newest updates and help me improve the app.\n\n<ExternalLink text=\"Google Play\" href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.github.sirpryderi.astrophotographycalculator\" icon=\"google-play\" />\n","frontmatter":{"name":"Astrophotography Calculator","priority":70},"fields":{"type":"projects","slug":"astrophotography-calculator"}}},"pageContext":{"ownerNodeId":"51e543d6-ea15-5f46-bca8-ce53ead1f534","id":"51e543d6-ea15-5f46-bca8-ce53ead1f534","type":"projects","frontmatter":{"name":"Astrophotography Calculator","priority":70}}},"staticQueryHashes":["1912835088"],"slicesMap":{}}
