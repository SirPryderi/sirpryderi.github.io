I decided to convert my one-page website to Jekyll in order to make it more easy to maintain.
Using Markdown to write content about my projects intrigued me, and and very easily managed
to convert my previous hand-crafted HTML5 website to a more dynamically generated one.

The process was surprisingly easy, and less than a day I managed to have something that converted
markdown in the exact equivalent of the previous website, without having to touch any of any of the
existing CSS.

Reached that point, expanding it even further would have been an easy feat, so I used
[Jekyll Collections](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/step-by-step/09-collections/)
for my projects and games, automatically generating dedicated pages form them, and handy indexes that helped
me reduce the amount of content in the landing page.

The whole process was extremely easy, fun and satisfying, I would recommend it to anyone that is in doubt.

The only thing missing, at this point, was the blog section, so here we go! ðŸ˜ƒ
