## About Vittorio Iocolano (aka SirPryderi)

I've been a full-time software engineer since I took an Applied
Computing degree in 2019 at the University of Stirling, Scotland.

I am proficient in web development, but my curiosity leads me towards learning
and experimenting with different technologies and programming languages,
giving me a all-round knowledge in everything that is related to code.

In my free time, I enjoy making free and open source applications of different
nature, including simulation, tooling and thought-provoking games.

Programming aside, I love photography, hiking, cycling, video games, and space
exploration <span class="hide-sm">(have you noticed the rocket?)</span>.

## Projects

Check out all the projects I'm working on my GitHub [github.com/SirPryderi](https://github.com/SirPryderi/){:target="\_blank"}.

### Open Hosts Editor

Free and open source application to edit the `/etc/hosts` file
for rooted Android devices. It is developed in Java and makes use of Linux
shell commands to perform its core operations. The application has over
100,000 installs worldwide.

### Astrophotography Calculator

Simple and intuitive app to calculate the ideal exposure time while shooting astrophotography.

Stars are not fixed in the sky (rather they appear not to because of Earth's rotation), so exposing for too long will start showing motion blur. Calculating the correct exposure time on the field can be tricky, and many approximation rules (e.g.: 400 rule) are often way off from the actual value. This app just solves all of that!

### Elysium Bot for Discord
Elysium Bot is a Discord bot that helps with Disco Elysium based campaigns.

It is backed by a Google Sheet spreadsheet with the characters information.

### Radial Audio Switcher

A C# WPF application that allows to change the audio output device using a video-game-like radial menu.

In my opinion this a much better way of changing the audio device, as it requires way less clicks.

### Astrarium

A Java application capable of calculating orbits, and launch windows to
execute transfers between them. The program features a 2D preview of the
transfer, shown as a map of the Solar system, and attempts to make the UIs
as neat and light as possible.

## Games

Check out all the games I've made at [sirpryderi.itch.io](https://sirpryderi.itch.io/){:target="\_blank"}.

### Green Inc.

As part of my final year project, I developed a prototype of a game that
conveyed a strong message about climate change. The game was designed to
be a management game, where the player takes the role of a fictitious
company that has to reduce global emissions. The game was developed in
Unity with C#.

### SimOrbit

A javascript-based orbital mechanics simulator. It is useful to learn more
about geocentric orbits and how they change with directional burns.

### Elephant in a Nutshell

A javascript based old school game, with some odd irony and nonsense in
it. The fate of the elephant might be in your hands!

## Photography

I am also very passionate about photography, both from the technical and
artistic point of view. I am always looking around to find the perfect subject
for my pictures, be it a flower, a building, or a person. Follow
