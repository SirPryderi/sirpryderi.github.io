## About Vittorio Iocolano (aka SirPryderi)

I've been a full-time software engineer since I took an Applied
Computing degree in 2019 at the University of Stirling, Scotland.

I am proficient in web development, but my curiosity leads me towards learning
and experimenting with different technologies and programming languages,
giving me a all-round knowledge in everything that is related to code.

In my free time, I enjoy making free and open source applications of different
nature, including simulation, tooling and thought-provoking games.

Programming aside, I love photography, hiking, cycling, video games, and space
exploration <span class="hide-sm">(have you noticed the rocket?)</span>.

## Photography

I am also very passionate about photography, both from the technical and
artistic point of view. I am always looking around to find the perfect subject
for my pictures, be it a flower, a building, or a person. Follow
