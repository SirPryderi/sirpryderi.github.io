I'm Vittorio (he/him), a full-stack engineer based in Scotland. I've
been writing code professionally since 2015, but my real passion lies in
building software that sparks joy.

I combine technical expertise but without losing track of what brings
customers value, always asking _"what if we tried it differently?"_

When I'm not coding, you'll find me playing (or designing!) board games,
capturing the world through my camera lens, or exploring Scotland's trails on
foot or by bike.
